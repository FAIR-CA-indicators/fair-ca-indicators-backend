The included diseases are obesity, diabetes, and rheumatic diseases; both the affected individuals themselves and their parents will be interviewed.\nInterdisciplinary collaboration between pediatricians of various specialties, psychologists, and epidemiologists will allow a comprehensive evaluation of the effects of COVID-19 on health care and the physical and mental health of children and adolescents with chronic conditions and their families, as well as the complex interplay between health status and health care as well as environmental and personal contextual factors.\nFor this, questions for the children and adolescents and their parents will be implemented as part of the standard survey in the Diabetes-Patienten-Verlaufsdokumentation (DPV), the Adipositas-Patienten-Verlaufsdokumentation (APV) and the Kerndokumentation rheumakranker Kinder und Jugendlicher (KRhOKo). In addition, all participants are invited to participate in a further online survey on the psychosocial situation and available resources. After one year, a follow-up takes place for both surveys. The prospective design allows both the detection of short- and long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on well-being and the analysis of mediator and moderator effects. The aim is to find approaches to help those families with children and adolescents affected by a chronic condition."

Interruptions in consultations (self-construction), the therapeutic intensity (self-construction) and the child's mental health (PHQ-9, GAD-7) are recorded. In addition, the child's media consumption (Lampert, Sygusch &amp; Schlack, 2007), the effects of the corona pandemic on family and everyday life (self-construction), the experience of stress (self-construction), risk perception (self-construction) and well-being (WHO-5 Well-being Index). For children under the age of 12, parents/guardians are asked to provide their child's assessment.\nThe children and adolescents from the age of 9 and the parent/guardian are then invited to a further online study.\nThe questionnaire for parents includes the following constructs: corona-specific burden (according to Calvano et al. 2021, modified), well-being (WHO-5; SAM; De Jong-Gierveld loneliness scale) together with the quality of life (SF-8; SF-36 fatigue scale; CHQ; FLQ), psychosocial adjustment (PHQ-4; ADNM8; PSS-4), also referred to ones role as parent (CGSQ-SF11; BPBS), resources (ASKU; IE-4; RS-11; OSLO), parental coping with the child's illness (CHIP-D), parenting behavior (APQ-9; according to Clemens et al.), child’s problem behavior (SDQ), its resources (self-construction) and its corona-specific coping (according to COSMO). In addition, social desirability (SEA-K), socioeconomic status (MacArthur scale; Winkler index) and some demographic information are recorded.\nThe questionnaire for children and adolescents includes the corona-specific burden (based on Calvano et al., 2021), well-being (SAM; KIDCSREEN-27; De-Jong-Gierveld Loneliness Scale), the parent-child relationship (EBF-KJ), resources (FRKJ-8-16; Benefit-finding-Scale), coping (CODI), problem behavior (SDQ) and social integration.",
