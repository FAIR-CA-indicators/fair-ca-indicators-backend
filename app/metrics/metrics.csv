"CA-RDA-F1-01Archive","Essential","Archive is identified by a persistent identifier","This indicator evaluates whether or not the archive is identified by a persistent identifier. A persistent identifier ensures that the metadata will remain findable over time and reduces the risk of broken links.","The persistence of an identifieris determined by the commitment of the organisation that assigns and manages the identifier, so the evaluation of this indicator needs to take into account the persistence policy of that organisation. Such a commitment could be expressed by a university or research institute, by a research infrastructure or by an organisation that issues formal identifiers, such as the International DOI Foundation. A possible way to evaluate this indicator is to verify that the identifier used for the metadata is listed ina registry service like the RDA-endorsed FAIRsharing."

The FAIR principle F3, which emphasizes that metadata should clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data they describe, is broadly applicable to any type of resource that can be distinctly identified and referenced. This principle ensures that each piece of metadata is directly linked to its corresponding data or document, thereby enhancing the findability and accessibility of research resources.","Check if the list of resource ids contains an identifier that either has the relation “A describes B” or “A is metadata for B”.
