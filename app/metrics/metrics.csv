"CA-RDA-F1-01Archive","Essential","Archive is identified by a persistent identifier","This indicator evaluates whether or not the archive is identified by a persistent identifier. A persistent identifier ensures that the metadata will remain findable over time and reduces the risk of broken links.","The persistence of an identifieris determined by the commitment of the organisation that assigns and manages the identifier, so the evaluation of this indicator needs to take into account the persistence policy of that organisation. Such a commitment could be expressed by a university or research institute, by a research infrastructure or by an organisation that issues formal identifiers, such as the International DOI Foundation. A possible way to evaluate this indicator is to verify that the identifier used for the metadata is listed ina registry service like the RDA-endorsed FAIRsharing."
